Inputs
==========================
This is a brief summary of the inputs required for beam_me_up.py, which is the workhouse of this package. For a more detailed description, look at the description in [link to the module doc here].

Compulsory arguments
poloidal_launch_angle_Torbeam -> Poloidal launch angle, in degrees. Positive angles corresponds to the mirror pointing downwads (towards the ground)
toroidal_launch_angle_Torbeam -> Toroidal launch angle, in degrees. Positive angles corresponds to the mirror pointing leftwards (left of the centre column)
launch_freq_GHz -> Probe beam frequency, in GHz
mode_flag -> 
launch_beam_width,
launch_beam_curvature,
launch_position,
